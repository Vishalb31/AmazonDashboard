Amazon Prime Shows & Amazon Sales Analysis ðŸ“Š

Project Overview
This project includes the creation of two interactive and dynamic dashboards using Power BI, based on datasets sourced from Kaggle:

1.	Amazon Prime Show Analysis
2.	Amazon Sales Analysis

Both dashboards were built with the help of powerful DAX measures to enhance insights and user interactivity.

Datasets

â€¢	Amazon Prime Show Dataset â€” [Sourced from Kaggle]
â€¢	Amazon Sales Dataset â€” [Sourced from Kaggle]

Tools and Technologies Used
1.	Power BI

2.	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

3.	Kaggle Datasets

What I Have Done
1.	Imported and cleaned the Amazon Prime and Sales datasets.

2.	Built two separate and professional dashboards in Power BI.

3.	Used DAX functions to create custom measures like:

â€¢	Total Revenue

â€¢	Total Orders

â€¢	Average Rating

â€¢	Top Categories

â€¢	Sales Growth, and more.



Added interactive slicers, filters, page navigators, and tooltips for a better user experience.
Applied a clean and attractive visual design to make insights easily understandable.

Amazon Prime Show Dashboard
1.	Displayed number of shows by year.
2.	Showed distribution by genres and countries.
3.	Highlighted ratings and viewer trends.
4.	Added slicers to filter by release year, country, and genre.

Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard
1.	Displayed overall revenue trends and top-selling products.
2.	Analyzed sales by country and product categories.
